Problem

While the most typical type of dice have 6
sides, each of which shows a different integer 1 through 6, there are many games that use other types. In particular, a dk is a die with k sides, each of which shows a different integer 1 through k. A d6 is a typical die, a d4 has four sides, and a d1000000 has one million sides. 

In this problem, we start with a collection of N dice. The i-th die is a dSi, that is, it has Si sides showing integers 1 through Si. A straight of length ℓ starting at x is the list of integers x,x+1,…,x+(ℓ−1)

. We want to choose some of the dice (possibly all) and pick one number from each to form a straight. What is the longest straight we can form in this way?
Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T
. T test cases follow. Each test case is described in two lines. The first line of a test case contains a single integer N, the number of dice in the game. The second line contains N integers S1,S2,…,SN

, each representing the number of sides of a different die.
Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x
: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y

is the maximum number of input dice that can be put in a straight.
